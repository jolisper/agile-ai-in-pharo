# Agile Artificial Intelligence in Pharo

This repo is all about my dive into Agile AI using Pharo. It's pretty much my playground for learning and messing around with AI concepts in a cool, object-oriented way with Pharo.

## What's Inside

- Exercises and notes from my learning.
- Experimenting with AI models and Agile practices.
- Source code in Tonel format (easy on version control).

## FYI

- Not really looking for contributions, this is my personal learning log.
- Feel free to snoop around or suggest stuff - always happy to learn more!
- Everything here is under MIT License.

Enjoy poking around!
